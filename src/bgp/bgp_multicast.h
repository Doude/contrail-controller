//
// This class represents membership of an end system in a (G,S) within a
// inet multicast table.  An end system is an entity that participates in
// edge replicated multicast and is typically a physical server but could
// also be some kind of gateway device that connects the distribution tree
// to other more traditional multicast distribution trees.
//
// There's a 1:1 correspondence between a route in an InetMcastTable and
// a McastForwarder. Routes in the InetMcastTable are keyed by RD, Group
// and Source. When these routes are processed, we invert the information
// and create a McastSGEntry for each unique (G,S).  Information from the
// RD and the IPeer from which we learnt the route is used to construct a
// McastForwarder. The McastForwarder is part of a set in the McastSGEntry
// for the (G,S).
//
// A McastForwarder is created when the DBListener for the McastTreeManager
// sees a new route in the InetMcastTable. It's deleted when the DBListener
// detects that the route in question has been marked for deletion.
//
// The McastForwarder is associated with the InetMcastRoute by setting it
// to be the DBState for the McastTreeManager's listener id.  Conversely,
// the McastForwarder maintains a back pointer to the InetMcastRoute. The
// LabelBlockPtr is copied from the BgpAttr of the route's active path.
// It's used to allocate labels for the McastForwarder without needing to
// reach into the route.  More importantly, it's required to release the
// currently allocated label when the route gets marked for deletion, at
// which time there's no active path for the route.
//
// A McastForwarder contains a vector of pointers to other McastForwarders
// within the same McastSGEntry. The collection of these links constitutes
// the distribution tree for the McastSGEntry. Note that only a single MPLS
// label is used for a McastForwarder in a given distribution tree.  Hence
// the label can be stored in the McastForwarder itself and does not need
// to be part of the link information.
